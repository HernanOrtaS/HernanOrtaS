<h3>Personal experience:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href='https://github.com/HernanOrtaS/Gestion-Escolar---Laravel'>School Management</a></b><br>I developed a project using Laravel and Python inside Docker containers to quickly generate student grades and certificates. The system uses real data from a database connected through a Python API. All queries are dynamic and executed in real time. The generation process is handled by the DomPDF library, and if there is an issue with the original data, it can be corrected before the generation process starts.</li><br>
  <li><b><a href='https://github.com/HernanOrtaS/natPHP_Limpiador'>Cleaner Product Calculation</a></b><br>I built a cleaning product calculator using Laravel to calculate the necessary amount of product required to clean a measured surface. The calculation is based on different floor types, products, and environments such as kitchens, dining rooms, and reception areas. It is a Single Page Application developed with Livewire, SQLite, and configuration data provided by the user.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Self-taught learning:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have been learning and working with PHP/Laravel for the past year. I started by studying PHP without frameworks or external tools to understand its core concepts. Once I understood the MVC architecture, I began learning Laravel and the various tools it provides, such as Blade templates, Eloquent ORM, and Livewire components to dynamically update the user-side interface.</li> </ul>

<h3>Student Experience:</h3>
Worked with multiple languages and tools to develop projects related to:
<ul>
<li>Statistics and Machine Learning with Python</li>
<li>Game Development with Unity</li>
<li>Arduino Circuits</li>
</ul>
